# Disclaimer
Well, this is an open-source alternative for a piece of software, called "mouseless" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0rwQVNQkHM
I found this idea pretty cool, but, since I can't afford it, I decided to just write my own alternative for it!
Now only works with linux on the X window system.
It is in a somewhat active development.

Personally, I have never used ".c" language before in my life, so most of the code came from AI-helpers.

# Features
You can move your mouse by typing one of the letter pairs displayed on the overlay and then you have a few choices.
1) Press Spacebar to move in a middle of the cell and click
2) Press Return(Enter) to move in a middle of the cell without a click
3) Press Any of the main keyboard keys excluding two middle rows for a better precision inside the cell.

There is also a double-triple click functionality.

Also there are a few modificators:
1) Holding ALT will use right click
2) Holding Shift will allow you to select text.
3) CTRL modificator is unused for now.
