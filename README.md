# keymouse

Well, this is an open-source alternative for a piece of software, called "mouseless" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0rwQVNQkHM
I found this idea pretty cool, but, since I can't afford it, I decided to just write my own alternative for it!
Now only works for linux with X window system.
It is in a somewhat active development.

Personally, I have never used ".c" language before in my life, so most of the code came from AI-helpers.
